<h1>ESPHome Device Configuration Repository</h1>

<p>This website is a repository of device configuration templates and setup guides for devices running <a
    href="https://esphome.io">ESPHome</a> firmware.</p>


<p>The goal is to document all devices capable of running the firmware along with a basic configuration yaml that can be
  easily copied and uploaded which restores the device back to its original functionality. Additionaly, more advanced
  configuration of devices could also be documented.</p>

{% assign counter = 0 %}{% for item in site.devices %}{% assign counter=counter | plus:1 %}{% endfor %}
<p>There are currently <strong>{{ counter }} devices</strong> documented in the repository.</p>
